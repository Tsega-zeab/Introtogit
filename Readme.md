# Transistors

transistors are the very core of todayâ€™s technology. It is a three terminal device using two closely spaced point contacts on a wafer of germanium.it is a three terminal device and consists of three distinct layers. Two of them are doped to give one type of semiconductor and there is the opposite type, i.e. two may be n-type and one p-type, or two may be p-type and one may be n-type... They are arranged so that the two similar layers of the transistor sandwich the layer of the opposite type. As a result these semiconductor devices are designated as either PNP transistors or NPN transistors according to the way they are made up. The names of the three electrodes are : ## Base: 
The base of the transistor gains its name from the fact that in early transistors, this electrode formed the base for the whole device. The earliest point contact transistors had two point contacts Placed onto the base material. This base material formed the base connection . . . and the name stuck. 
## Emitter:
The emitter gains its name from the fact that it emits the charge carriers
