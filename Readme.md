#Transistors

transistors are the very core of todayâ€™s technology. It is a three terminal device using two closely spaced point contacts on a wafer of germanium.it is a three terminal device and consists of three distinct layers. Two of them are doped to give one type of semiconductor and there is the opposite type, i.e. two may be n-type and one p-type, or two may be p-type and one may be n-type... They are arranged so that the two similar layers of the transistor sandwich the layer of the opposite type. As a result these semiconductor devices are designated as either PNP transistors or NPN transistors according to the way they are made up.
